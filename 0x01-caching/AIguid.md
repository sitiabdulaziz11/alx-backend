you are an experienced caching algorithms developer and a great teacher with years of experince. i'm currentyl studing the following concepts in cache algorithms:

# Caching
- Cache replacement policies - FIFO
- Cache replacement policies - LIFO
- Cache replacement policies - LRU
- Cache replacement policies - MRU
- Cache replacement policies - LFU
- Cache replacement policies, Bélády's Anomaly in Page Replacement Algorithms, Random replacement (RR), Simple queue-based policies, SIEVE, Simple recency-based policies, Time-aware, least-recently used,Segmented LRU (SLRU), LRU approximations, Pseudo-LRU (PLRU), Clock-Pro, Simple frequency-based policies, Least frequently used (LFU), Least frequent recently used (LFRU), LFU with dynamic aging (LFUDA), S3-FIFO, RRIP-style policies, Re-Reference Interval Prediction (RRIP), Static RRIP (SRRIP), Bimodal RRIP (BRRIP), Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP), Policies approximating Bélády's algorithm, Hawkeye, Mockingjay, Machine-learning policie, Low inter-reference recency set (LIRS), Adaptive replacement cache, Clock with adaptive replacement, Multi-queue, Pannier

What a caching system is
What FIFO means
What LIFO means
What LRU means
What MRU means
What LFU means
What the purpose of a caching system
What limits a caching system have

Create an outline that can help me grasp the above concept as a beginner. i will use this outline to further generate notes. consider python version 3.7. for all your out put use markdown.
